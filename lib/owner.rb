# When an owner plays with a cat or feeds a fish or walks a dog, that pet will get happier.
# Remember that the pets method stores all of an owners pets.
# The @pets hash stored in that method is full of instances of the Cat/Dog/Fish class.
# That means you can call Cat/Dog/Fish instance methods (such as .mood=) on those pets.
